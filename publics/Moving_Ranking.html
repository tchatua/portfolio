<h1>The Best Movies According to Tchatua</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Designated Survivor</h3>
<p>
    Designated Survivor" is not a movie, but a political thriller drama television series 
    created by David Guggenheim. It premiered on ABC and later aired on Netflix. 
</p>
<p>
    The show follows Tom Kirkman (played by Kiefer Sutherland),
    a low-level cabinet member who becomes President of the United States after 
    a catastrophic attack during the State of 
    the Union kills everyone above him in the presidential line of succession. 
</p>

<h3>A Few Good Men</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the movies, 
    I have watched many many times. 
    First few times, 
    Tom Cruise seemed to be giving an ordinary performance; 
    probably my shortcoming that I was not able to understand his character. 
    But, then I realized that he was playing exactly the character he was supposed to portray 
    and he did it in a impeccable manner - wow!!!! 
    He was just second to Jack Nicholson.

<h3>The Book of Eli</h3>
<p>
    The Book of Eli" is a generally well-regarded post-apocalyptic film, 
    particularly praised for its visuals, acting, and unique take on the genre. 
    While not universally acclaimed, it's considered a visually stunning and thought-provoking movie with a memorable performance from Denzel Washington.
