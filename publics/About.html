<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arristide Tchatua, a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong background in DevOps, 
    dedicated to building efficient, scalable, and secure digital solutions. With hands-on experience in both 
    front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy transforming complex ideas into user-friendly interfaces and 
    robust backend systems. From crafting seamless user experiences with JavaScript, React and even Web3 development,
    to architecting reliable APIs and databases with Node.js, and NoSQL and SQL Databases, I take pride in delivering 
    high-quality, maintainable code. 
</p>
<p>
    My DevOps skills empower me to bridge the gap between development and operations. 
    I'm well-versed in CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, 
    ensuring that applications are not only built rightâ€”but deployed and maintained effectively.
</p>
<p>
    Hereâ€™s what I bring to every project:<br />
    âœ… End-to-end development: From initial design to deployment and monitoring.<br />
    âœ… Automation & deployment: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services, IaC, Scripting, Monitoring, Automation and more.<br />
    âœ… Problem-solving mindset: I love debugging, optimizing, and scaling apps.<br />
    âœ… Continuous learning: Always exploring new technologies to enhance my stack.<br />
    When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new tech communities, mentoring juniors, or experimenting with the latest DevOps tools.
</p>
<p>
    Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
